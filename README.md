# Project Crescendo 🎬

`💠 Team Apollo's project is creating a video service where users can watch uploaded videos from content creators that can be shared via tinyUrl that shortens web service, which provides short aliases for redirection of long URLs.`

## Team - Apollo👬👭

`💠 Derived from the greek God Apollo who was a major Greek god associated with the bow, music, and divination. The epitome of youth and beauty, source of life and healing, patron of the arts, and as bright and powerful as the sun itself, Apollo was, arguably, the most loved of all the gods.`
